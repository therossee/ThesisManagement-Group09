## Introduction

The backend is implemented as a RESTful API, leveraging Node.js and the Express framework to provide seamless data interactions with the frontend. 

Its primary purpose is to handle data management, authentication, and communication with external services. By seamlessly integrating with the frontend, the backend ensures a smooth user experience and robust functionality. 

Whether you're a developer looking to contribute or a user seeking insights into the backend workings, this README will guide you through the essential information about our backend architecture, setup, and usage. 

Let's get started! ðŸš€

## Features

1. **RESTful API**

    Our backend provides a RESTful API to facilitate communication between the frontend and server. This enables efficient data retrieval, modification, and storage.

2. **Node.js and Express**  

    <p>
      <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=plastic&logo=node.js&logoColor=white">
      <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-404D59?style=plastic">
    </p>
    
    Built on the Node.js runtime and utilizing the Express framework, our backend is designed for scalability, performance, and ease of development.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
    
    Ensuring secure access, our backend implements authentication mechanisms to verify user identities and authorization controls to manage user permissions effectively.

4. **Database Integration**

    ![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-07405E?style=plastic&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)

    The backend seamlessly integrates with a database system to store and retrieve data, ensuring persistent and organized information for the application.
5. **Programming Language**

    ![JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-blue?logo=javascript&logoColor=f5f5f5)

    The entire backend infrastructure is implemented using the JavaScript programming language. This includes the use of JavaScript for defining controllers, Data Access Objects (Dao), error handling, middlewares, and routes. This choice provides consistency and ease of maintenance, as all the code, from handling user requests to database access logic, is written in a single language, simplifying development and enhancing code readability.

6. **Collaborative Development with GitHub**
    
    
    
    Our development process has been entirely collaborative, leveraging the GitHub platform. Through GitHub, team members have seamlessly collaborated on code contributions, tracked changes, and managed the project's development lifecycle. This approach ensures transparency, version control, and efficient teamwork, fostering a streamlined and organized development process.



## Getting Started

Instructions on how to set up and run the backend.

### Prerequisites

<p>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Node%20js-339933?style=plastic&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-CB3837?style=plastic&logo=npm&logoColor=white">
</p>

Before running the backend, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
   

### Installation

    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=plastic&logo=linux&logoColor=black"  alt="Linux" height='30px'>
  </p>

1. **Clone the repository**: 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/therossee/ThesisManagement-Group09.git
   ```
2. **Go inside the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

To run the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have completed the installation steps mentioned above.

2. Run the following command (in the backend directory) to start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
The server will start, and you should see console logs indicating that the server is running.

## Backend Project Structure
The backend project is divided into 3 parts :
- `src` => source code of the API
- `test` => all unit/integration tests of the project
- `.` => all the configuration (.pem key, environment, ...)

### src directory
The source directory has been divided into different folder to simplify the readability of the code:
- `controllers` => each file contains one or more functions used in routers ONLY to handle the request and response.
- `dao` => each file contains one or more dao function used to interact with the database. All the database logic is implemented here.
- `enums` => each file contains one or more enum object AND the file `index.js` exports all enums from the directory.
- `errors` => each file is equal to a class representing an error that can be formatted to be sent through an express response (see `src/middlewares/errors.js`).
- `middlewares` => each file contains one or more function used as middleware for express application/router.
- `models` => each file contains a class representing a model of an entity.
- `routers` => each file contains one router exported as default. The router contains all API endpoint related to his domain.
  - They are used in the `app.js` file to register the router to the express application.
- `schemas` => each file contains one or more "zod" schemas object used to validate user input AND the file `index.js` exports all schemas from the directory. 
- `services` => each file contains one or more service class/function used to interact logically. Some of the domain logic is implemented here.

The `index.js` file is the entry point where the HTTP server is created/set up. While the `app.js` file is used to set up the express application and is used in test directory to create a fake server for integration testing.

### test directory
The test directory contains integration and unit testing of the backend. To simplify readability tests are divided 
into 2 folders:
- unit
- integration

The root of the directory contains some utils methods/variables for the execution of tests

## Middlewares

### Authentication
The authentication middleware is defined in `src/middlewares/authentication.js`.
It uses the `passport-saml` library to authenticate users using SAML2.0.

### Authorization
Several middleware functions are defined to check user authentication and roles. These include:
- `isLoggedIn`: Checks if the user is authenticated.
- `isStudent`, `isTeacher`, `isTester`, `isSecretaryClerk`: Checks if the authenticated user has the specified role.

### Error Handling
The error handling middleware is defined in `src/middlewares/errors.js` and expose all middlewares needed
to handle errors and send a response to the client.

## Test

### Testing Overview
Our backend is equipped with a comprehensive suite of tests, including both unit and integration tests, implemented using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework.

![Jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jest-C21325?style=plastic&logo=jest&logoColor=white)

### Running Tests
To run the tests, execute the following command in the backend folder:

 ```bash
npm run test
 ```

### Test Coverage Report
Upon completion of the tests, a detailed HTML coverage report will be generated. The report will open in your browser and here you can gain insights into the test coverage. This provides a visual representation of how well our code is tested, helping ensure its robustness and reliability.

We encourage contributors to run tests regularly and review the coverage report to maintain the high quality and integrity of our codebase.
